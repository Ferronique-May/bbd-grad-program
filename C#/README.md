# C#

The intention of this folder is to organize and store all related C# content from the __GRAD PROGRAM__. 

### Please note:
- All C# projects should be put in this folder as a sub-folder using appropriate naming convention
- Each sub-folder should have it's _own_ __README.md__ file, with all neccesary detail on the project. Including how to run it, what depedencies are needed, etc.
- Please remember to use naming conventions that make sense
