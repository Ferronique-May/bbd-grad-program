# Data Types

## What is a Data Type?

- A label that tells the complier or the programming language how it should be processed.

### Primitive Examples

- Boolean
- Integer
- String
- Float
- Objects
- Arrays

### Non Primitive Examples
Collections:
- Arrays
- Tuples
- Trees (binary trees, etc) - really good for path finding. Commonly used in AI.


## Primitive vs Non-primitive(Composites)

- Primitive types are predefined
- Non-primitive types are created by the programmer. They are a combination of different data types.

## What is a function?

- A block of code that performs a task and can be reused.

## Difference between Dynamic and static Typing.

- Dynamic ->  Types checked on the fly, during execution
- Static -> Types checked before run-time

## What is Recursion? 

- When a function calls itself in itself. It allows you to solve seemingly complicated problems in a simple way.

## What is an iterator?

- It allows you to loop through a collection. A collection that can be transversed over.

## Difference between pure and impure function?

- Pure functions are predictable we that if given an input we can expect a specific output as there are no side effects.
- Impure functions, however are less predictable and has a larger possibilty of a side effect.

## What is an exception?

- Something that is outside of the normal expectation. We throw exceptions when we can do something useful with that error. You should catch the exception when you are in the method that knows what to do with that error.
